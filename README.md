This Deep Q Network utilizes Pytorch in order to train an agent on the game Tetris.

How it works: This agent utilizes Reinforcement Learning to determine what actions should be taken in order to maximizes reward. The use of Q-Learning allows for the agent to seek future rewards instead of more immediate rewards.

Training Outcome: At first the agent selects seemingly random actions. After several hundred episodes it begins to play at an human-esque level. After several thousand episodes it is able to play at a level that surpasses what a human capable of. After the 10,000 assigneged episodes it is able to make optimal decisions nearly instuntaniously and loss has been reduced to near-zero.
